## Step 1: Setting Up pfSense

This section explains how to set up **pfSense** in your SOC automation project. It includes installation, configuring the WAN and LAN interfaces, setting up firewall rules, and exporting logs to Splunk.

### 1. Download and Install pfSense on a Virtual Machine

You will first need to download and install pfSense on a virtual machine (VM) using software like **VMware Workstation**, **VirtualBox**, or any other preferred virtualization platform.

#### Steps to Install pfSense:

- **Download pfSense ISO**:
    - Visit [pfSenseâ€™s official download page](https://www.pfsense.org/download/) and select:
        - **Architecture**: AMD64 (64-bit)
        - **Installer**: ISO Installer
        - **Mirror**: Choose the closest download mirror.

- **Set Up pfSense in Your Virtual Machine (VM)**:
    - Open **VMware** or **VirtualBox** and create a new virtual machine:
        - **Operating System**: Select FreeBSD 64-bit.
        - **Memory**: Allocate at least 1GB of RAM (depending on your system's resources).
        - **Storage**: Allocate at least 10GB for the pfSense VM.
    - Attach the **pfSense ISO** to the virtual machine.
    - Start the VM and follow the pfSense installation wizard:
        - Select 'Install pfSense' during the boot process.
        - Choose the default keyboard layout and disk partition options.
        - Complete the installation and reboot the VM.

### 2. Configure the WAN and LAN Interfaces

Once pfSense is installed, you will need to configure the **WAN** and **LAN** interfaces.

#### Steps to Configure Interfaces:

- When pfSense boots up, it will automatically try to detect the **WAN** and **LAN** interfaces. Typically:
    - **WAN Configuration (em0)**:
        - If using **DHCP**, pfSense will automatically assign an IP address to the WAN interface.
        - For **Static IP** setups, manually assign an IP address.
    - **LAN Configuration (em1)**:
        - The default LAN IP is `192.168.1.1/24`.
        - You can access pfSense via a web browser by connecting to this IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.1`).

#### Accessing the Web Interface:

- Open a browser on the host machine or another VM that shares the same LAN subnet.
- Navigate to `http://192.168.1.1`.
- Log in using the default credentials:
    - **Username**: `admin`
    - **Password**: `pfsense`
- Follow the setup wizard to configure the hostname, domain, and DNS server.

### 3. Set Up Firewall Rules to Log Traffic

After configuring the interfaces, create firewall rules to log specific traffic types for monitoring and analysis in Splunk.

#### Steps to Configure Firewall Rules:

- In the **pfSense Web Interface**, go to **Firewall > Rules**.
- Select either the **LAN** or **WAN** tab depending on where you want to control traffic.
- Click **Add** to create a new rule:
    - **Action**: Choose `Pass` or `Block`, depending on what traffic you want to log.
    - **Source**: Define the IP range or network from which the traffic originates (e.g., **LAN subnet** or a specific IP like `192.168.65.132`).
    - **Destination**: Set the destination (e.g., `Any`, `WAN address`, etc.).
    - **Protocol**: Specify whether you want to log **TCP**, **UDP**, or **ICMP** traffic (e.g., for ping requests).
    - **Log Option**: Enable "Log packets that are handled by this rule" to log the traffic.

Once the rules are set up, pfSense will begin logging traffic based on the defined rules.

### 4. Export Logs to Splunk

To analyze firewall logs, export pfSense logs to Splunk via syslog.

#### Steps to Export pfSense Logs to Splunk:

1. **Enable Remote Logging on pfSense**:
    - In the **pfSense Web Interface**, go to **Status > System Logs > Settings**.
    - Scroll down to the **Remote Logging Options** section.
    - Enable the **Send log messages to remote syslog server** option.
    - Enter the IP address of your **Splunk server** in the **Remote log servers** field.
        - Example: `192.168.1.154:514` (assuming Splunk is running on the host machine with IP `192.168.1.154`).
    - Select the log categories you want to forward (e.g., **Firewall events**, **System events**).
    - Save the changes.

2. **Configure Splunk to Receive Logs**:
    - In the **Splunk Web Interface**, navigate to **Settings > Data Inputs > UDP**.
    - Click **New UDP** and set the port to **514** (standard syslog port).
    - Set the **Source Type** to `syslog` and assign an index (e.g., `pfsense_logs`).
    - Save the settings, and Splunk will start receiving logs from pfSense.

3. **Verify the Logs in Splunk**:
    - Go to **Search & Reporting** in Splunk and search for logs from pfSense:
      ```splunk
      index=pfsense_logs sourcetype=syslog
      ```
    - You should now see the logs coming from pfSense, which can be filtered, visualized, and analyzed.

By following these steps, you should have pfSense fully installed, configured, and exporting logs to **Splunk** for traffic monitoring and security analysis.
