### Step 4: Using CyberOps for Advanced Testing and Automated Response

In this step, we will configure a **CyberOps VM** to simulate advanced attack scenarios and test automated incident response mechanisms using **Splunk** and **pfSense**. CyberOps is used to mimic real-world security operations, including security testing and monitoring for intrusion detection.

### 1. Install and Set Up CyberOps VM

You will need a virtual machine with appropriate security tools and testing utilities installed. Here, we’ll guide you through setting up the **CyberOps VM** and integrating it with your SOC setup.

#### Steps to Install CyberOps VM:

- **Create a New Virtual Machine** in **VMware Workstation** or **VirtualBox**:
    - Use a base OS like **Ubuntu**, **CentOS**, or **Windows** based on your needs.
    - Allocate at least **2GB RAM** and **20GB disk space**.
  
- **Install Security Tools**:
    - **SIEM Testing Tools**: Install utilities like **Sysmon**, **OSQuery**, and other logging tools to monitor endpoint activity.
    - **Incident Response Tools**: Install tools such as **TheHive**, **Cortex**, or **MISP** to handle incident response and threat intelligence management.
    - **Testing Utilities**: You can also install **Nmap**, **Metasploit**, **Hydra**, and other security tools used for advanced testing.

### 2. Advanced Testing with CyberOps

With the **CyberOps VM**, you can simulate advanced attacks and test real-time responses in your SOC. Here are some use cases:

#### Common Scenarios for CyberOps Testing:

1. **Simulating Insider Threats**:
    - Using **Sysmon** to detect unusual activity on the system, like unauthorized access or file modifications.
    - Monitor logs in **Splunk** for unusual patterns of behavior originating from the CyberOps VM.

2. **Threat Intelligence Integration**:
    - Install **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)** to simulate threat intelligence feeds.
    - Use **MISP** to generate and share threat intelligence indicators (IPs, domains, hashes) and correlate them with logs collected in **Splunk**.

3. **Simulated Data Exfiltration**:
    - Use **Nmap** or **Netcat** to simulate data exfiltration attempts from the CyberOps VM.
    - Monitor firewall logs in **pfSense** for any unusual outgoing traffic that may indicate exfiltration, and create corresponding alerts in **Splunk**.

4. **Brute Force Attack Simulation**:
    - Simulate brute force attacks against specific services like **SSH** or **HTTP** running on **pfSense** or other VMs in the network.
    - Use **Hydra** from the CyberOps VM to launch the attack and track blocked attempts in **Splunk**.

### 3. Automated Incident Response Using Splunk

You can configure **Splunk** to automate certain incident response actions based on logs collected from **pfSense** and other VMs. Here’s how to do that:

#### Steps to Set Up Automated Responses:

1. **Create Real-Time Alerts**:
    - Go to **Search & Reporting** in Splunk and set up an alert based on specific criteria, such as:
      ```splunk
      index=pfsense_logs action=block OR action=alert
      ```
    - Configure the alert to trigger when a threshold (e.g., number of blocked connections) is met.

2. **Configure Response Actions**:
    - **SOAR Integration**: If using **Splunk Phantom** or another **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)** platform, configure playbooks for automated responses.
    - Examples of automated actions include:
      - **Blocking IP addresses** in pfSense based on attack detection.
      - **Sending automated alerts** via email or messaging platforms like **Slack**.
      - **Triggering response scripts** to isolate a compromised VM.

3. **Simulate Real-Time Incidents**:
    - Perform real-time simulations of incidents such as:
      - DDoS attacks from CyberOps VM.
      - Brute force login attempts.
      - Data exfiltration tests.
    - Observe how **Splunk** detects and responds based on the automation you’ve set up.

### 4. Monitor Results and Refine Security Settings

After simulating various attacks and automating responses, it’s important to analyze the results and adjust your SOC setup to improve detection and response.

#### Monitoring and Analysis:

- **Visualize Attack Data**:
    - Use Splunk’s **dashboard** and **visualization** tools to display attack patterns, source IPs, blocked attempts, and overall security posture.
  
- **Refine Firewall Rules**:
    - Based on the simulated attacks and responses, adjust pfSense firewall rules for better protection.
  
- **Tune Incident Response**:
    - Fine-tune Splunk alerts and automated playbooks to ensure quick and accurate responses to potential threats.

By completing this step, you will be able to simulate advanced security scenarios using **CyberOps**, automate responses using **Splunk**, and enhance the overall security of your SOC environment.
