## Overview of Playbooks
Playbooks are manuals that provide detailed operational actions for responding to security incidents. They include predefined steps that must be followed during an incident response, outlining expectations and assigning responsibilities to team members. Playbooks are living documents that are updated regularly to address changes in industry standards, evolving threats, and any identified failures.

## Purpose of Playbooks
- **Strategy**: Outlines team expectations and responsibilities.
- **Plan**: Details how specific tasks must be completed.
- **Updates**: Regular updates ensure relevance in the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape.

## Reasons for Updating Playbooks
- Identification of failures or oversights in procedures.
- Changes in laws, regulations, or compliance standards.
- Evolution of threat actor tactics and techniques.

## Types of Playbooks
Playbooks can cover specific incidents and vulnerabilities, such as ransomware, business email compromise (BEC), and other common attacks. Different organizations have varying playbooks depending on their protocols, procedures, and legal requirements.

### Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks
These playbooks are widely used by entry-level cybersecurity professionals and align with an organizationâ€™s business continuity plan. They provide steps to follow during incidents to ensure compliance and minimize errors, helping organizations recover and continue operations after disruptions.

### Common Steps in Incident and Vulnerability Playbooks
- **Preparation**: Getting ready for potential incidents.
- **Detection**: Identifying when an incident occurs.
- **Analysis**: Investigating the incident to understand its impact.
- **Containment**: Limiting the spread of the threat.
- **Eradication**: Removing the threat from the environment.
