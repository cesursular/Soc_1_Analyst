# Control Categories in Cybersecurity

## Overview
Controls in cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories: Administrative/Managerial, Technical, and Physical controls. Each category addresses different aspects of security and works together to protect assets and data.

## Control Categories

### 1. Administrative/Managerial Controls
These controls address the human aspect of cybersecurity and include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and employee responsibilities. Examples include:
- **Least Privilege**: Preventative; reduces risk from malicious insiders.
- **Disaster Recovery Plans**: Corrective; ensures business continuity.
- **Password Policies**: Preventative; reduces the likelihood of account compromise.
- **Access Control Policies**: Preventative; defines data access rules.
- **Account Management Policies**: Preventative; manages account lifecycle and reduces risk.
- **Separation of Duties**: Preventative; limits the impact of compromised accounts.

### 2. Technical Controls
Technical controls involve solutions such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, antivirus software, and encryption. Examples include:
- **Firewall**: Preventative; filters unwanted traffic.
- **IDS/IPS**: Detective; identifies and prevents anomalous traffic.
- **Encryption**: Deterrent; ensures confidentiality of sensitive data.
- **Backups**: Corrective; restores data after an event.
- **Password Management**: Preventative; reduces password fatigue.
- **Antivirus (AV) Software**: Corrective; detects and quarantines threats.

### 3. Physical Controls
Physical controls limit access to physical assets. Examples include:
- **Time-Controlled Safe**: Deterrent; reduces the impact of physical threats.
- **Adequate Lighting**: Deterrent; limits hiding places for threats.
- **CCTV**: Preventative/Detective; reduces event risk and informs post-event conditions.
- **Locking Cabinets**: Preventative; prevents unauthorized access to network gear.
- **Locks**: Deterrent/Preventative; secures physical assets from unauthorized access.
- **Fire Detection and Prevention**: Detective/Preventative; detects and prevents damage from fires.

## Control Types
Control types describe how each control functions to protect assets and provide defense in depth:
1. **Preventative Controls**: Designed to prevent incidents from occurring (e.g., firewalls, password policies).
2. **Corrective Controls**: Used to restore assets after an incident (e.g., backups, disaster recovery plans).
3. **Detective Controls**: Implemented to determine if an incident has occurred (e.g., IDS, CCTV).
4. **Deterrent Controls**: Designed to discourage attacks (e.g., encryption, locks).

## Key Takeaways
- Controls are categorized as Administrative, Technical, and Physical.
- Control types include Preventative, Corrective, Detective, and Deterrent.
- A defense-in-depth approach ensures comprehensive security by using a combination of these controls.
