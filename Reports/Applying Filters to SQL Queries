# Applying Filters to SQL Queries

## Project Description
As part of my role, I ensure the security of our organizationâ€™s system by investigating potential security issues and updating employee computers as needed. Below are examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.

## SQL Queries with Filters

### 1. Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts
A potential security incident occurred after business hours (after 1800). Failed login attempts occurring after hours need investigation.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;
```

**Explanation:**
This query filters for failed login attempts that occurred after 1800. It selects all data from the `log_in_attempts` table, then uses a `WHERE` clause with an `AND` operator to filter results to those occurring after 1800 (`login_time > '18:00'`) and were unsuccessful (`success = FALSE`).

### 2. Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates
Suspicious events occurred on 2022-05-09 and the previous day. These login activities need investigation.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08';
```

**Explanation:**
This query returns all login attempts from 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08 by selecting data from `log_in_attempts` and using a `WHERE` clause with an `OR` operator.

### 3. Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico
Investigation revealed potential issues with login attempts occurring outside of Mexico.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE country NOT LIKE 'MEX%';
```

**Explanation:**
This query filters for login attempts from countries other than Mexico by using `NOT LIKE 'MEX%'` to match all variations representing Mexico.

### 4. Retrieve Employees in Marketing
The Marketing department in the East building requires computer updates.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%';
```

**Explanation:**
This query filters employees working in the Marketing department and located in the East building using `LIKE 'East%'` to match specific office numbers.

### 5. Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales
Employees in Finance and Sales departments need different security updates.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';
```

**Explanation:**
This query filters employees from Finance or Sales departments using the `OR` operator.

### 6. Retrieve All Employees Not in IT
Security updates are needed for employees not in the Information Technology department.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department != 'Information Technology';
```

**Explanation:**
This query filters for employees not in the IT department using the `!=` operator.

## Summary
I applied filters to SQL queries using the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` operators along with the `LIKE` operator and the `%` wildcard to retrieve specific data from the `log_in_attempts` and `employees` tables for targeted security investigations.
