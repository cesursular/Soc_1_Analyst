Security Risk Assessment Report
Part 1: Selected Hardening Tools and Methods

    Multifactor Authentication (MFA): Implementing multiple layers in authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
    Firewall Maintenance and Port Filtering: Filtering traffic and regularly updating security configurations to protect the network.
    Patch Updates: Applying the latest patches to fix security vulnerabilities in systems and applications.

Part 2: Recommendations and Explanations
1. Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

    Why Effective: MFA significantly reduces unauthorized access by adding multiple factors to the authentication process. It provides an extra layer of security even when passwords are accidentally shared or compromised.
    Frequency of Implementation: Initial setup followed by regular maintenance checks.

2. Firewall Maintenance and Port Filtering

    Why Effective: Firewall maintenance and port filtering block potential attackers from accessing the network and filter out dangerous traffic from specific ports, reducing the risk of unauthorized entry and malware infiltration.
    Frequency of Implementation: These configurations need regular reviews and updates, typically weekly or monthly, to maintain effectiveness.

3. Patch Updates

    Why Effective: Applying current patches addresses known vulnerabilities, preventing attackers from exploiting weaknesses in the system.
    Frequency of Implementation: Security patches should be applied as soon as they are released to ensure systems are protected from newly discovered threats.
