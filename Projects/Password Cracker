Password Cracker Project
Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of popular password-cracking tools, Hashcat and John the Ripper, to understand how passwords can be cracked and the importance of strong password policies. The goal is to analyze the effectiveness of different password-cracking techniques.
Requirements

    Kali Linux (or another Linux distribution)
    Hashcat
    John the Ripper
    A password hash file (hashes.txt)
    A wordlist (rockyou.txt)

Step 1: System Setup and Updates

Ensure your system is up to date with the latest packages:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

Step 2: Hashcat Installation and Setup

Verify Hashcat Installation:

hashcat --version

If not installed:

sudo apt-get install hashcat

Creating a Password Hash File: Create a file with password hashes to test cracking. Example of creating MD5 hashes:

echo -n 'password123' | md5sum >> hashes.txt
echo -n 'admin2024' | md5sum >> hashes.txt

Using Hashcat with Dictionary Attack: Crack the hashes using a wordlist:

hashcat -m 0 -a 0 -o cracked.txt hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

Step 3: Using John the Ripper

Verify John Installation:

john --version

If not installed:

sudo apt-get install john

Cracking Passwords with John the Ripper:

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt

Viewing Cracked Passwords:

john --show hashes.txt

Step 4: Analysis and Reporting

    Analyze the Results: Review which passwords were cracked and how quickly.
    Create a Report: Document the findings, including the types of attacks used and their success rates.

Project Outputs

    Configuration and setup of Hashcat and John the Ripper
    Analysis of cracked passwords
    Detailed report on findings

Extra: Best Practices for Strong Passwords

Include a section on how to create strong passwords and avoid common weaknesses that were exploited during the project.
