Project Description

This project demonstrates step-by-step how to set up a Honeypot using Cowrie, an SSH and Telnet Honeypot designed to capture and log malicious activities. The purpose is to analyze attackers' behaviors in a controlled environment.
Requirements

    Virtual Machine (VM) with Linux (preferably Ubuntu 20.04 or Kali Linux)
    Python 3 and Git installed
    Internet connection

Step 1: System Updates and Installation of Dependencies

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git python3-virtualenv

Step 2: Installation of Cowrie Honeypot

git clone https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie.git
cd cowrie
virtualenv cowrie-env
source cowrie-env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Configuring Cowrie

Edit the configuration file to adjust how Cowrie operates:


nano etc/cowrie.cfg

Change SSH Port: Set the port to 22 to make the Honeypot appear more realistic.

[ssh]
listen_endpoints = tcp:22:interface=0.0.0.0

Log File Location: Define where the logs will be stored:


    [output_jsonlog]
    enabled = true
    logfile = /var/log/cowrie/cowrie.json

Step 4: Starting Cowrie

bin/cowrie stop
bin/cowrie start

Step 5: Testing the Honeypot

Find the IP address of the machine where the Honeypot is installed:

ifconfig

Use the IP address to connect via SSH from another device to test the Honeypot:

ssh user@<honeypot_ip_address>

Step 6: Monitoring and Analyzing Logs

To watch the logs live:

tail -f log/cowrie.log

Step 7: Attack Analysis and Reporting

    Analyze the logs to identify attack methods (e.g., brute force attempts).
    Document your findings in a report and share it along with the project documentation on your GitHub.

Project Outputs

    Step-by-step setup and configuration of Cowrie Honeypot
    Logs of captured attacks and analysis reports
    Project documentation and reports shared on GitHub

Extra: SIEM Integration

For more comprehensive analysis, integrate Honeypot logs with a SIEM platform like Splunk or QRadar.
