# **Linux Discretionary Access Control (DAC) Model Demonstration**

This project demonstrates how to apply the **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)** model in a Linux environment. We assign and manage individual permissions for a file using standard Unix permissions and Access Control Lists (ACLs). The setup involves multiple users and controlled file access.

---

## **Project Structure**
- **`/home/kali/Desktop/dac/`**: Project directory containing a sample file.
- **`dac.txt`**: File used to demonstrate DAC permissions.

---

## **Steps to Reproduce**

### **1. Create the Project Directory and File**
1. Navigate to the Desktop:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop
Create a directory and a file:

mkdir dac
cd dac
touch dac.txt

Verify file permissions:

ls -l dac.txt

Expected output:

    -rw-rw-r-- 1 kali kali 0 <date> dac.txt

2. Create Additional Users

    Create two new users:

sudo adduser user1
sudo adduser user2

Confirm the users were added:

cat /etc/passwd | grep user

Expected output:

    user1:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/user1:/bin/bash
    user2:x:1002:1002:,,,:/home/user2:/bin/bash

3. Set File Permissions Using ACL

    Assign read-only permissions to user1 and user2 for dac.txt:

sudo setfacl -m u:user1:r dac.txt
sudo setfacl -m u:user2:r dac.txt

Verify ACL settings:

getfacl dac.txt

Expected output:

    # file: dac.txt
    # owner: kali
    # group: kali
    user::rw-
    user:user1:r--
    user:user2:r--
    group::rw-
    mask::rw-
    other::r--

4. Adjust Directory Permissions

To ensure users can access the directory containing the file:

    Add execute permissions to /home:

sudo chmod o+x /home

Add execute permissions to /home/kali:

sudo chmod o+x /home/kali

Verify directory permissions:

ls -ld /home
ls -ld /home/kali

Expected output:

drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 <date> /home
drwx-----x 17 kali kali 4096 <date> /home/kali

Add read and execute permissions for user1 to the dac directory:

sudo setfacl -m u:user1:rx /home/kali/Desktop/dac

Verify ACL settings for the directory:

getfacl /home/kali/Desktop/dac

Expected output:

    # file: dac
    # owner: kali
    # group: kali
    user::rwx
    user:user1:r-x
    group::rwx
    mask::rwx
    other::r-x

5. Test Permissions

    Log in as user1:

su - user1

Navigate to the directory and verify access:

    cd /home/kali/Desktop/dac
    cat dac.txt

    Expected behavior:
        user1 can read the file.
        user1 cannot write to the file.

Notes

    This project demonstrates the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model.
    File permissions are managed dynamically using Access Control Lists (ACLs).
    Directory permissions are adjusted to allow controlled access while maintaining security.
