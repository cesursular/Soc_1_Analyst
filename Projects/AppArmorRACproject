# AppArmor Project

This project demonstrates how to use AppArmor to create security profiles for applications and manage their access securely.

---

## **1. What is AppArmor?**
AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) mechanism for the Linux kernel. It enhances system security by restricting applications' access through profiles. Compared to SELinux, AppArmor is more user-friendly.

---

## **2. Installing AppArmor**

### **Installing Required Packages**
To install AppArmor and its utilities:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apparmor apparmor-utils -y

Starting and Enabling the Service

    Start the service:

sudo systemctl start apparmor

Enable the service to start on boot:

    sudo systemctl enable apparmor

Checking AppArmor Status

sudo aa-status

3. Creating a Profile
Example: Creating a Profile for a Script

    Create a new script:

echo "echo 'Hello from AppArmor!'" > ~/example_script.sh
chmod +x ~/example_script.sh

Generate a profile for the script:

sudo aa-genprof ~/example_script.sh

Interactive Process:

    Run the application when prompted:

        ~/example_script.sh

        Allow or deny access based on system log events during the profile setup.

    Complete the profile setup:
        Choose "Scan system log" to analyze logs for required permissions.
        Choose "Finish" to save the profile.

4. Testing the Profile
Check Loaded Profiles

sudo aa-status

Test the Profile

Run the script to verify that the profile works as expected:

~/example_script.sh

5. Editing the Profile

    Edit the profile file:

sudo nano /etc/apparmor.d/home.kali.example_script.sh

After making changes, reload the profile:

    sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/home.kali.example_script.sh

6. AppArmor Modes
Complain Mode:

To run the profile in complain mode (logging violations without enforcement):

sudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/home.kali.example_script.sh

Enforce Mode:

To enforce the profile (actively restrict violations):

sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/home.kali.example_script.sh

7. Reviewing Logs

To check AppArmor logs for violations:

sudo dmesg | grep apparmor

If using rsyslog:

sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep apparmor

8. Creating Additional Profiles

To create a profile for another application:

sudo aa-genprof /path/to/application
