# SIEM Setup and Malicious Activity Simulation with Splunk

## Project Overview
This project involves setting up Splunk as a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform to monitor and detect malicious activities on a home network. Simulated attacks such as Brute Force attempts, Nmap Port Scans, PowerShell command execution, and Ping Flood (DDoS) were used to test custom detection rules created in Splunk.

## Objectives
- Set up Splunk as a SIEM platform.
- Collect and ingest logs from various sources, including Windows Event Logs and network traffic.
- Create custom detection rules in Splunk to identify specific malicious behaviors.
- Simulate cyber-attacks and analyze detection results.

## Tools Used
- **Splunk**: For log collection, analysis, and alerting.
- **Nmap**: To perform network reconnaissance through port scanning.
- **PowerShell**: To execute potentially malicious commands for testing.
- **Ping**: To generate high ICMP traffic to simulate a DDoS attack.
- **Wireshark/Tcpdump**: For capturing network packets.

## Project Steps

### 1. SIEM Platform Setup
- Installed Splunk and configured it on the local machine.
- Added data inputs:
  - **Windows Event Logs:** Collected system, security, and application logs.
  - **Syslog:** Configured to collect logs from network devices.

### 2. Data Collection
- Logs from Windows Event Log, syslog, and captured network traffic were ingested into Splunk.
- Verified that data was successfully indexed and available for search.

### 3. Custom Detection Rules
Created detection rules to identify the following activities:

#### **Rule 1: Brute Force Login Detection**
- **Purpose:** Detect multiple failed login attempts to identify brute force attacks.
- **Search Query:**
  index=main source="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
  | stats count by Account_Name, ComputerName
  | where count > 5

    Description: This rule triggers an alert if there are more than 5 failed login attempts from the same account.

Rule 2: Nmap Port Scan Detection
    Purpose: Identify port scanning activities conducted by Nmap.
    Search Query:
    index=* sourcetype=*network* OR sourcetype=*firewall* OR sourcetype=*syslog*
    | search "Nmap" OR "port scan" OR "SYN scan" OR "connection attempt"
    Description: Searches for common terms associated with Nmap scans to detect suspicious scanning behavior.

Rule 3: Malicious PowerShell Command Execution
    Purpose: Detect potentially harmful PowerShell commands.
    Search Query:
    index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4104
    | search "Invoke-WebRequest"
    Description: Detects commands like Invoke-WebRequest often used for downloading malicious payloads.

Rule 4: High ICMP Traffic (Ping Flood) Detection

    Purpose: Detect high levels of ICMP traffic indicative of a DDoS attack.
    Search Query:
    index=* sourcetype=*network*
    | stats count by src_ip
    | where count > 100
    Description: Monitors for unusually high ICMP packet counts from a single IP source.

4. Malicious Activity Simulation

Executed the following commands to simulate malicious activities:
A. Brute Force Login Simulation
    Steps:
        Repeatedly entered incorrect passwords on the Windows login screen to generate failed login attempts.

B. Nmap Port Scan Simulation

    Command:
    nmap -sS -p 1-1000 <target_IP>
    Description: Conducted a SYN scan on the target IP address to simulate reconnaissance.

C. Malicious PowerShell Command Execution

    Command:
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://example-malicious-site.com
    Description: Simulated a command that downloads data from an external URL.

D. Ping Flood Simulation

    Command:
    ping -t <target_IP>
    Description: Sent continuous ping requests to generate high ICMP traffic.

5. Analysis and Results

    Verified that all simulated activities were detected by the custom Splunk alerts.
    Adjusted detection rules based on the results to optimize accuracy.

Results

    Splunk successfully detected the simulated attacks using the custom rules and alerts.
    The setup and detection process provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of Splunk as a SIEM tool in a home network environment.

Future Improvements

    Enhance Detection Rules: Continue refining the detection rules to catch more sophisticated attack patterns.
    Integrate Additional Data Sources: Expand the setup to include IDS/IPS logs and other network monitoring tools.
    Automate Response Actions: Implement automated responses for certain detected activities to improve the security posture.
